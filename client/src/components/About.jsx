                <h1>Welcome to the Tennis Ladder</h1>
                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    The objectives are to have fun and meet people to play with.
                    We welcome players of all skill levels.
                </p>
                <h2>Commitment</h2>
                <p>
                    By signing up for this ladder, you are committing to
                    finding time to play at least one match per week.
                    This is only fair to the other players in the ladder.
                    Usually, two matches are scheduled for each player each week,
                    but your ranking will only be affected if one plays neither.
                </p>
                <h2>Match Structure</h2>
                <p>
                    "Matches" are played as pro-sets until a winning score of at least 8 games.
                    One must win by two games. Ties of 8-8 are broken by tie-break games played
                    until someone scores 10 points (again, first to win by 2).
                    Examples of final scores are therefore:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>8-0</li>
                    <li>8-6</li>
                    <li>9-7</li>
                    <li>8-8, then tie-break: 10-8</li>
                    <li>8-8, then tie-break: 15-13</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Using this website</h2>
