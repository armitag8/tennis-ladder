    <h2>Welcome to the Tennis Ladder</h2>
    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>
        The objectives are to have fun and meet people at your skill level.
        We welcome players of all skill-levels.
    </p>
    <h3>Commitment</h3>
    <p>
        By sigining up for this ladder, you are committing to 
        finding time to play at least one match per week. This is only
        fair to the other players in the ladder.
    </p>
    <h3>Match Structure</h3>
    <p>
        "Matches" are actually played as pro-sets up to 8 games. One must win by two games.
        Ties of 8-8 are broken by tie-break games played to 10 points (first to win by 2).
        Examples of final scores are therefore:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>8-0</li>
        <li>8-6</li>
        <li>9-7</li>
        <li>8-8, then tie-break: 10-8</li>
        <li>8-8, then tie-break: 15-13</li>
    </ul>

    with a court supervisor at the tennis courts.</p>
